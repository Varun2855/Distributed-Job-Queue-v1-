# Distributed Job Queue System (v1)

## Overview

This project is a **backend job queue system** that allows users to submit tasks which are processed asynchronously by background workers.

Instead of handling long-running tasks during API requests, jobs are stored and processed separately — improving performance and scalability.

---

## Features

* User authentication (JWT-based)
* Job creation and tracking
* Asynchronous background worker
* Database-backed queue (v1 implementation)
* Modular FastAPI architecture

## What I learned

async job handling
producer (API) / consumer (worker) model
queue (DB-based)
background processing

---

## How It Works

1. User submits a job via API
2. Job is stored in the database with status `pending`
3. Worker process polls for pending jobs
4. Job is processed in the background
5. Status updates to `completed` or `failed`

---

## Tech Stack

* FastAPI
* SQLAlchemy
* Postgres
* JWT Authentication

---

## Running the Project

### Start API

```
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### Start Worker (separate terminal)

```
python worker/worker.py
```

---

## Project Status

**Version: v1**

This version demonstrates the core architecture of a distributed job queue system using a database-backed queue and a single worker process.

---

## Future Improvements

This is a foundational implementation and can be extended with:

* Redis-based queue
* Multiple worker processes with proper locking
* Retry mechanism for failed jobs
* Monitoring & dashboard
* Rate limiting

---

## Notes

The focus of this project is on **system design and architecture**, not the complexity of individual job tasks.
